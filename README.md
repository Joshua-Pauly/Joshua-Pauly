<h2>Purpose</h2>
<b>Welcome to my GitHub profile! This repository is dedicated to showcasing my experience and work in the field of Artificial Intelligence, with a particular focus on computer vision. Here, you'll find a collection of projects, research, and contributions that reflect my journey in AI. 

This platform serves as a space to share my projects, research, and contributions as I work towards this goal. Feel free to reach out I would love to connect over a shared passion for AI.
